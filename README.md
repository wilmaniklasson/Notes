# Note App

A simple note-taking application built in React.

## Features

- **Create Notes:** Enter a new note in the text input and click "Save" to add it.
- **Delete Notes:** To remove a note, click on the trash can icon inside the note.
- **Toggle Dark/Light Mode:** Switch between dark mode and light mode for better readability.
- **Search Notes:** Use the search bar at the top to search for specific notes by typing keywords or phrases.

Your notes are stored locally in the browser's storage. This means that your notes will persist even if you close the browser or refresh the page.
